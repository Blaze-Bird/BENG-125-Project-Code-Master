Mp =   %mRNA for PER
Mt =   %mRNA for TIM
T1 =    % unphosphorylated TIM
T2 =    % monophosphorylated TIM
P0 =    %Native protein
P1 =     %monophosphorylated protein
P2 =      %biphosphorylated protein
Pn =        % Nuclear protein
C =        % PER-TIM complex concentration
Cn =        % PER-TIM complex in the nucleus which is a repressor
kdc =        % degradation rate of PER-TIM in cytoplasm
kdn =       % degradation of PER-TIM in nucleus
% as D increases oscilations increase
